# PHP assessment

Assess your skills as a PHP Developer
-------------------------------------

Please follow these steps carefully.  Failure to do so may result in you not being considered for the position we currently have open.

1) Review the CCProcessor.php script in this repository. Imagine you inherited this script and were told to do whatever you think is necessary to take ownership of the script (it will be your responsibility moving forward). 

2) Fork this repository

3) Create a new branch on your fork named your first name followed by a period followed by your last name.  All steps below should be on your newly created branch.

4) Create a new file called My-Thoughts.md and in that file.  Put your full name on line one of that file and your email address on line two.  In the lines that follow, using everyday plain English, please explain anything you would change/add/remove from the CCProcessor.php script. 

5) Code is not necessary, but if you feel it is the best way to explain some of your changes, feel free to include it by editting the CCProcessor.php file.

6) If you were to make any changes to the CCProcessor.php script, please explain (in your My-Thoughts.md file) what you would do afterward to reintegrate the script back into a production environment?

7) Create a pull request with the changes from your fork/branch.

Good luck!
